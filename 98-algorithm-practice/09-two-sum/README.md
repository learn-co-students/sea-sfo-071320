# Two Sum

Given an array of numbers and a target, return the two indicies from the array which would amount to the target value. You are only able to use each number once, and you may assume that there *is* a set of numbers which will add up to the target. 

## Example:
```javascript
twoSum([1,5,9,2,15,10], 11);
    => [2, 3]
twoSum([1,7,45,19,4,98], 143);
    => [2, 5]
```
