# Make Change
Given a numerical value between 0. and 1.0, return a hash which contains key/value pairs of the coin types and how many of each coin you would need to make exact change. 

## Example:
```javascript
makeChange(0.87);
    => { Quarters: 3, Dimes: 1, Nickles: 0, Pennies: 2 }
makeChange(0.43);
    => { Quarters: 1, Dimes: 1, Nickles: 1, Pennies: 3 }
```

Loosely based on multiple coin-change problems all over the web.
